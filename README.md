# ProtoGain
WORK STILL IN PROGRESS

In this repository you may find a PyTorch implementation of Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) [[1]](#1) for imputing missing iBAQ values in proteomics datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  `git clone https://github.com/QuantitativeBiology/ProtoGain/`
2. Create a Python environment: `conda create -n proto python=3.10` if you have conda installed
3. Activate the previously created environment: `conda activate proto`
4. Install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## How to Use

If you just want to impute a general dataset, the most straightforward and simplest way to run ProtoGain is to run: `python protogain.py -i /path/to/file_to_impute.csv`
Running in this manner will result in two separate training phases.

1) Evaluation run: In this run a percentage of the values (10% by default) are concealed during the training phase and then the dataset is imputed. The RMSE is calculated with those hidden values as targets and at the end of the training phase a `test_imputed.csv` file will be created containing the original hidden values and the resulting imputation, this way you can have an estimation of the imputation accuracy.

2) Imputation run: Then a proper training phase takes place using the entire dataset. An `imputed.csv` file will be created containing the imputed dataset.


However, there are a few arguments which you may want to change. You can do this using a parameters.json file (you may find an example in `ProtoGain/breast/parameters.json`) or you can choose them directly in the command line.

Run with a parameters.json file: `python protogain.py --parameters /path/to/parameters.json`<br>
Run with command line arguments: `python protogain.py -i /path/to/file_to_impute.csv -o imputed_name --ofolder ./results/ --it 2001`

#### Arguments:

`-i`: Path to file to impute<br> 
`-o`: Name of imputed file<br> 
`--ofolder`: Path to the output folder<br> 
`--it`: Number of iterations to train the model<br> 
`--miss`: The percentage of values to be concealed during the evaluation run (from `0` to `1`)<br>
`--outall`: Set this argument to `1` if you want to output every metric<br> 
`--override`: Set this argument to `1` if you want to delete the previously created files when writing the new output<br> 



If you want to test the efficacy of the code you may give a reference file containing a complete version of the dataset (without missing values): `python protogain.py -i /path/to/file_to_impute.csv --ref /path/to/complete_dataset.csv`

Running this way will calculate the RMSE of the imputation in relation to the complete dataset.


## Demo

In this repository you may find a folder named `breast`, inside it you have a breast cancer diagnostic dataset [[2]](#2) which you may use to try out the code.

`breast.csv`: complete dataset<br>
`breastMissing_20.csv`: the same dataset but with 20% of its values taken out


To simply impute `breastMissing_20.csv` run: `python protogain.py -i ./breast/breastMissing_20.csv` <br>
If you want to compare the imputation with the original dataset run: `python protogain.py -i ./breast/breastMissing_20.csv --ref ./breast/breast.csv` or `python protogain.py --parameters ./breast/parameters.json`


If you want to go deep in the analysis of every metric you either set `--outall` to `1` or you run the code in an IPython console, this way you can access every variable you want in the `metrics` object, e.g. `metrics.loss_D`.
